## About

A fork of "Oh My CV!". You can visit the original work [here](https://ohmycv.app/).

Changes I made from the original work:
- Default template is now as close as possible with [CareerCup's](https://www.careercup.com/resume) resume template.
- Default color is all Black.
- Added Web-safe fonts for easier ATS parsing.
- And many more ...

## Notice

Highly recommend using Chromium-based browsers, e.g., [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge).

## Features

- Export to A4 and US Letter size PDFs
- Customize page margins, theme colors, line heights, fonts, etc.
- Pick any fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)

  - No user tracking, no ads

## Development

It's built on [Nuxt 3](https://nuxt.com), with the power of [Vue 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-next), [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite), [Zag](https://zagjs.com/), and [UnoCSS](https://github.com/antfu/unocss).

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Build some [packages](packages):

```bash
pnpm build:pkg
```

To enable picking all fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/), you will need to generate a [Google Fonts Developer API Key](https://developers.google.com/fonts/docs/developer_api#APIKey). Then, create a `.env` file in [`site`](site/) folder and put:

```
NUXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_FONTS_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Start developing / building the site:

```bash
pnpm dev
pnpm build
```
